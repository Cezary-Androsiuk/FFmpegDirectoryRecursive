# FFmpegDirectoryRecursive

## About
It is a twin project to [FFmpegDirectory](https://github.com/Cezary-Androsiuk/FFmpegDirectory), but upgraded to handle recursive directories.
Installation instructions are in ```main.cpp```, but it requires FFmpeg to be already installed. 
Check out [FFmpegDirectory](https://github.com/Cezary-Androsiuk/FFmpegDirectory) for more screenshots!

The algorithm is armed with many more tools to protect and facilitate file compression. As soon as I find time to do so, I will describe the operation of both algorithms.
